Since learning and applying Agile in my work as a member of a development team until taking on the role of team manager, what I always wanted was to promote team bonding and self-organization. That's why I always want all team members to understand what they're doing and the product we develop together by let them contribute opinions and perspectives in all the meeting or product brainstorming. Allowing all team members, regardless of experience level, to contribute their perspectives helps build a sense of ownership and encourages diverse thinking, which is crucial for innovation and team growth.

But what makes me observe from actually participating in meetings and discussions is the arguments between members. When someone raises a slightly complicated problem, and another person dismisses another's concern by saying, "Why are you overthinking this?" or "Let's keep it simple," it can stifle meaningful discussion and prevent deeper understanding of the issue. No matter wether it is right or wrong, this kind of exchange can indeed be unproductive, as it might shut down thoughtful consideration of the problem rather than fostering a constructive dialogue.

In a healthy debate, it's important to encourage open-mindedness and thorough exploration of issues, even if they are complex. Instead of dismissing someone's point, it could be more helpful to ask clarifying questions or explore why they believe the issue is more complex. This approach can lead to a more collaborative and effective problem-solving process.

I encourage curiosity and respectful questioning. To me, all opinions are valuable and that complexity is sometimes necessary to fully address an issue can also help. By promoting a culture where clarifying questions are the norm, and where the focus is on understanding each other's perspectives, we can create a more inclusive and productive environment.
