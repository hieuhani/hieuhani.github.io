Recently, I have been reminiscing about my time when I was a university student. No matter what, those days were my best happy time.

I remember my presentation about the proverb "Jack of all trades, master of none" in my preparation English class.

At that time, I wasn't like that proverb. I believed I could get benefits by master of all and try to do whatever I want!

I enjoyed drawing and earned enough money from creating Chibi illustrations to buy my first music player.

I enjoyed cooking and have tried to cook nut milks, banh mi, Mapo tofu, ... I used to want to open a snack bar and to be a chef. I used to feel happy to see others eat my foods.

My software engineer's career path is not so different. I have developed myself to be a full stack, with expertise spanning application design, back-end services, and both front-end mobile/website development to the infrastructure deployment setup. However, I always strive to expand my knowledge and continuously learn to enhance my skills further. So the question is How much is enough? Sometimes I feel down every time I come across a deeper understanding of a topic that I am familiar with, especially when I realize I haven't explored it as thoroughly as I could. I am a fan of the OKR framework and have read 'Measure What Matters' by John Doerr. However, when I reflect on my experience as a full-stack developer and the many products I've built, I realize that none of them achieved significant success.

To determine the best next steps, I'll focus on answering the question 'What Matters.' While I'm pleased with my exploration, I need to clarify the path to achieving my desired outcome.
