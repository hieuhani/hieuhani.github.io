As described in the Scrum Guide, the Scrum Master is accountable for establishing Scrum. They do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice, both within the Scrum Team and the organization while serving the Scrum Team as well as the larger organization.

As [The 8 Stances of a Scrum Master](https://www.scrum.org/resources/8-stances-scrum-master) by Barry Overeem, a Scrum master utilizes their important soft skills to act as a **Servant Leader**, **Facilitato4411r**, **Coach**, **Manager**, **Mentor**, **Teacher**, **Impediment Remover** or **Change Agent**, depending on the situation at hand.

Agile is essentially a philosophy, a mindset for quickly adapting and responding to change, thereby achieving success in a constantly changing and uncertain environment, thinking Agile as a religion.

I see the Scrum Master is like a monk to help Scrum Team members practice Scrum framework and always keep in mind the Agile mindset.

The Scrum Master is the person in the middle to catalyze the creation of a working environment that is oriented towards the human in software development and is oriented toward empiricism and continuous value creation.
